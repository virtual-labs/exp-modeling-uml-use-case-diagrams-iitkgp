### About the Experiment 
Use case diagram is a platform that can provide a common understanding for the end-users, developers and the domain experts. It is used to capture the basic functionality i.e. use cases, and the users of those available functionality, i.e. actors, from a given problem statement.

In this experiment, we will learn how use cases and actors can be captured and how different use cases are related in a system.
